{"name":"Chrome-twilight","tagline":"Chrome Inspector Twilight Theme","body":"# Chrome Inspector Twilight Theme\r\n\r\nThis is just my implementation and is probably not 100% what you would expect. The way the Chrome inspector wraps things is different to how code editors do it, so it's not possible to get it _identical_, but we can get a close approximation.\r\n\r\nIncludes the Elements, Resources (view js/css/html file), Sources (view js/css/html file), and Console panels; styles for the toolbar (Elements/Resources/Network/etc); and even view source styles (note: not JS/CSS view source though - that's not possible at the moment).\r\n\r\nAs always, if you see something that you can improve on, please do so and send a pull request :)\r\n\r\n## DISCLAIMER\r\n\r\nPlease note: custom themes are unofficial and may potentially break existing DevTools functionality.\r\n\r\nAs always, if you encounter bugs with the DevTools, please [report them][crbug], but disable the theme and test again, first. ;)\r\n\r\n## The 3D\r\n\r\nI've added a 3D hover effect to the icons in the tabs. To see an example of the effect, see [this codepen][codepen-3d] I made to demonstrate how it works.\r\n\r\nIf you don't like the 3d tab icon version, I've created a branch without that effect [here][no-3d].\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\nNormal Elements panel\r\n\r\n![Elements Panel](https://raw.github.com/remybach/chrome-twilight/master/resources/elements.png)\r\n\r\nDock to right & floating Elements panel\r\n\r\n![Dock to Right & Floating Element Panel](https://raw.github.com/remybach/chrome-twilight/master/resources/dock_right-floating.png)\r\n\r\nSources Panel\r\n\r\n![Sources Panel](https://raw.github.com/remybach/chrome-twilight/master/resources/sources.png)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n[This post][installation] by [Darcy Clarke][darcy-clarke] should help you out.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n\r\n* If you come across any issues, please let me know by submitting an issue using the link above.
